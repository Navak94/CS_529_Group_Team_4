Hello everyone! This is the folder for **Group 1**.

## Getting Started

For our project, we're going to be using the yfinance dataset and experimenting with different methods to predict stock trends.
First run pip install yfinance pandas


If you haven't install seaborn then run: pip install seaborn to 

###  Examples

Currently, there are two example files explaining how yfinance works and how to output its data into a CSV file to make it more readable:

- `yfinance_example.py` – is just the base understanding for how yfinance gets it's data and the formatting we need to do.
- `yfinance_json_example.py` – is to show how we're going to read from the same json file for all of our methods.

 `companies.json` is our settings for dates and companies, that way all of our methods look at the same companies and dates.

###  Time Periods

All of our methods will be tested on the same stocks over the same date ranges. The only thing that will differ between each of us is **the prediction method** we use.
